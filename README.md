this is a project to solve a location-allocation problem as multi-objective problem with NSGA-II algorithm. the data for this project comes from Maputo city. in this problem each solution map each buliding block to each shelter. for further information read this paper :  : https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4893/13/1/16 
in the code folder you will find the whole code as a notebook. 
in this code there is an implementation for the objective functions.and there is an implementation for NSGA-II. then use a genetic algorithm for tuning the hyperparameters of NSGA-II algorithm. after that some visualization for statics like correlation matrix, box plot. make animations for showing each solution in the real map of Maputo city.
in the data folder you will find the data files of Maputo city.
in the result function
