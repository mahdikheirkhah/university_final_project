This is a project to solve a location-allocation problem, a multi-objective problem with the NSGA-II algorithm. The data for this project comes from Maputo city. In this problem, each solution maps each building block to each shelter. For further information read this paper : https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4893/13/1/16 

In the code folder you will find the whole code as a notebook. In this code there is an implementation for the objective functions, and there is an implementation for NSGA-II. Then tuning a genetic algorithm for tuning the hyperparameters of NSGA-II algorithm. After that, some visualization, for statics like correlation matrix, box plot, make animations for showing each solution on the real map of Maputo city.

In the data folder you will find the data files of Maputo city.

In the result folder you will find some results of the running of code. For example, in tuning the hyperparametes folder there is some statistical visualization of tuning hyperparametes of NSGA-II.
